To get a high grade in this course we had to create a project which our professors deemed to be "advanced". I and my lab partner worked on a game of Pong with working multiplayer and single-player modes. We also added an embedded AI to the game with increasing difficulty and a High Score system based on the number of hits each player successfully delivered. The project was created using the MIPS architecture and the C programming language. The project was given full marks.`,

          "The goal of my Engineering Skills course was to explain the foundation of what it means to be an engineer in the workforce. For this project, we had to write contracts, make a plan and separate the work into multiple sections.  When it came to the actual robot, the goal was to make it deliver a book to a designated target then go from one point to another. The twist was that we had to code this in the C language which I nor my teammates knew how to implement in the Mindstorms architecture. We ended up changing the operating system with ev3dev. The robot ended up being very successful however, the tracks we used ended up sliding quite a bit, so we had to add a function that added extra torque to the wheels to compensate for this. The project was given full marks and has been highlighted to future students because of its unique function.",

Using this Linux distrobution proved to be a challenge as I was unfamiliar with networking. I started learning the fundamentals, and after 3 months I switched to DD-WRT as it had other features which I wanted to try out. As of December 2021, I am running a VPN and FTP server on the router, with plans to set up a more secure file sharing protocol.`,
