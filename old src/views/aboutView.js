          I am a Swedish (grown up in the USA) computer science student at KTH,
          The Royal Institute of Technology.
        </p>
        <p className="aboutText">
          My ambitions are within technology and engineering, which were heavily
          focused during my time at the International Baccalaureate (IB).
        </p>
        <p className="aboutText">
          With previous experience in design and programming, I have designed
          and built multiple web pages while working at RE-DO. I have also built
          this online portfolio using React.

          <p className="aboutAnswer">
            I want to create code that helps users. I hope to have some kind of
            position where I am able to contribute to a role for a company I

            What are your strengths & weaknesses?
          </h3>
          <p className="aboutAnswer">
            I know I can always make my code more efficient. I consider this to
            be both a good and a bad thing. I will always find a way to write it
            better. However in that journey, I will learn, I will grow, and I
            will be ready for the next challenge.
