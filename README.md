# Personal Portfolio
## Introduction
This is the code for my personal portfolio, a CV that I put online at:

https://www.calexanderberg.com

Check it out.

## What technologies were used?
Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, SASS

## What were the biggest challenges and what did you learn?
I had no idea how to create a website and am still revisiting the code so I would say almost everything was a challenge.


## What are your next step to improve it?
1. Rewrite the code to follow the model-view-presenter.
2. Implement action buttons to allow pull requests to run tests, be built, and others before deployment.
3. Implement typescript to the code, see II1302 for a project where I used typescript

## Please note:
I realized after the fact I should have made a new branch for my current project of implementing improvement number 1. This has lead to a very messy repository which I am fixing whenever I have time.

Currently only the resources folder is the one that shows the code displayed on the website. This would most likely be where you want to see my actual code.

Thank you

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
