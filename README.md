# Personal Portfolio
## Introduction
This is the code for my personal portfolio, a CV that I put online at:

https://www.calexanderberg.com

Check it out.

## What technologies were used?
Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, SASS

## What were the biggest challenges and what did you learn?
I had no idea how to create a website and to this day I am still revisiting the code, trying to make it better and in the process learning about new technologies, such as NextJS, test-driven development, and typescript etc.


## What are your next step to improve it?
1. Rewrite the code to follow the model-view-presenter.
2. Implement action buttons to allow pull requests to run tests, be built, and others before deployment.
3. Implement typescript to the code, see II1302 for a project where I used typescript

## Please note:
I realized after the fact I should have made a new branch for my current project of implementing improvement number 1. This has lead to a very messy repository which I am fixing whenever I have time.

Currently only the resources folder is the one that shows the code displayed on the website. This would most likely be where you want to see my actual code.

Thank you

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
